# Social Network Promotion
## Introduce
This is my pet project to showcase my skills.

Project idea: decentralized promotion of social networks by creating simple tasks and rewarding users for completing them.

To begin with, I used the social network Twitter. At this time you can create tasks to track the follow to the group, as well as track the likes and retweets of a particular entry. In the future, I plan to add a discord bot and tasks for tracking activities in the discord itself.
